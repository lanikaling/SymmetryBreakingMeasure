    Define a 3d translation operation on atoms in Cartesian coordinate.

    Properties:
    -----------
    direction : np.ndarray
        The unit vector in Cartesian coordinate which specifies the direction
        of the translation.
    displacement : float
        A float number which specifies the length of movement along the
        direction. The size of the displacement should not be greater than the
        lattice parameter, i.e. the length of the unit cell.
    lattice : Lattice
        The lattice of the target unit cell. Default to be None.

    Method:
    -------

        Apply the translation operation to the given structure.
