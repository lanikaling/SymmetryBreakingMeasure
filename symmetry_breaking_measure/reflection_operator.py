class ReflectionOperator(BaseOperator):
    """
    Define a 3d reflection operation on atoms in Cartesian coordinate.

    Properties:
    -----------
    axis : np.ndarray
        The unit vector in Cartesian coordinate which is perpendicular to the
        reflection plane.
    origin : np.ndarray
        A point in Cartesian coordinate that the reflection plane passes
        through.
    lattice : Lattice
        The lattice of the target unit cell. Default to be None.


    Method:
    -------
    apply:
        Apply the reflection operation to the given structure. The method
        first translate the structure such that the origin is translated to
        the (0,0,0) point. Then it performs appropriate rotations to make the
        normal vector of the reflection plane at the origin until it coincides
        with the +z-axis. This makes the reflection plane the z = 0 coordinate
        plane. After that reflect the object through the z = 0 coordinate
        plane. Finally, it performs the inverse of the combined rotation
        transformation and the inverse of the translation in previous steps.
